I don’t think we can do that 

No it’s not possible 

I don’t think that’s a good idea 

These are common viewpoints of a can’t do attitude 

These are plagues of a team when a team member is adamant about halting a train of conversation with a can’t do attitude 

This can spread to other team members once one member is comfortable saying we can’t do it. As a leader you should have a can do attitude and promote it within your team. 

I was taught this by my good friend Brendan Foody 

He said - I don’t know about this hire, he seems to have a can’t do attitude

I inquired - what is that? 

Then it clicked when this member was always saying no we can’t do it and bringing up flimsy excuses of why something can’t be done. I added what if we did x? And it resulted in a new path to move forward

After a small investigation and a can do attitude we came up with a work around and we could continue progress 

One day later Brendan had a can’t do attitude when we tried to explore what’s app integration. I said what’s up with this can’t do attitude. He said you’re right Moises. I said let’s sit down and figure it out. It took me 3 days with a can do attitude to over coke Brendan’s can’t do to figure out a solution. 

Anything is possible with a can do attitude 

The alternative is the can do attitude 

What’s the work around? 

Have we tried x? 

Let’s try it again differently

Fortunately a can do attitude can spread just as much as a can’t do 

Let’s do it! 

Let’s get it done! 

We CAN DO it
